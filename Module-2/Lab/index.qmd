## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the importance of data wrangling in the data analysis process.
2. Transform and map raw data into a more suitable format for analysis.
3. Emphasize the significance of data cleaning and preparation.
4. Ensure data accuracy and consistency.
5. Make reliable and valid conclusions based on well-prepared data.

## What is Data Wrangling?

Data wrangling is the process of converting messy, untidy data into a tidy format, making it suitable for data visualization and analysis.

- **Data is often messy:** Real-world data is rarely provided in a tidy format.
- **Industry challenges:** Many industries have poorly designed data structures, requiring data preparation before visualization.
- **Rarely tidy datasets:** It is uncommon to receive a dataset that is already tidy.

## What Causes Untidy Data?

- **Incorrect/Inconsistent dates:** Dates can often be a headache due to inconsistencies.
- **Wide format times:** Time data is often given in a wide format instead of long.
- **Void or misspelled descriptions:** Descriptions can have gaps or missing/misspelled characters.
- **Missing values:** Many datasets have missing values in some rows or columns.
- **Condensed or incorrect headers:** Column names are often too short or mislabeled.
- **Row content split:** Sometimes, data in a single row needs to be divided into multiple columns.

Mastering data wrangling is crucial because you might have to handle datasets with millions of rows and hundreds of columns. 

In most cases, you will import data using SQL to create narrower datasets. However, when given large datasets, you can use R to manipulate and create subset datasets for focused analysis.

## Tidy Data

Tidy data is a structured format that aligns the organization of a dataset with its underlying meaning. In tidy data:

- **Each variable has its own column:** Every column in the dataset corresponds to a specific variable or attribute.
- **Each observation has its own row:** Every row captures a single observation or data entry.
- **Each cell contains a single value:** Each cell holds one distinct piece of information for a particular variable and observation.


## Getting stated with tidying data

First, ensure you have the necessary packages installed and loaded. We will use the `dplyr`, `lubridate`, `readr`, `ggplot2`, and `tidyr` packages for our examples.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
library(lubridate)
```

### Download the Data

```{webr-r}
#| autorun: true
# Specify the data URL using HTTPS
url1 <- "https://howarder.github.io/ST_437_Data_Viz/Datasets/countries.csv"
url2 <- "https://howarder.github.io/ST_437_Data_Viz/Datasets/countriesExtra.csv"

# Download the data files from the HTTPS URL and save it as
# countries.csv & countriesExtraInfo.csv
cat("Downloading the data ...\n")
download.file(url1, "countries.csv")
download.file(url2, "countriesExtraInfo.csv")

# Check for the data.
cat("After downloading the data, we now have:\n")
list.files()

# Read the countries data into R
countriesDs <- read_csv("countries.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
countriesExtraDs <- read_csv("countriesExtraInfo.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

### Verify Dataset with `head()`

```{webr-r}
head(countriesDs, 5)
head(countriesExtraDs, 5)
```

#### Description of the Dataset
- **`country`**: Country name from a predefined list of 10 countries.
- **`year`**: Years between 2010 and 2023.
- **`population`**: Real-world population size for each country and year.
- **`gdp`**: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in USD millions for each country and year.
- **`gdp_per_capita`**: GDP per capita, calculated as GDP divided by population.
- **`life_expectancy`**: Life expectancy of citzens
- **`birth_rate`**: Birth rate for each country and year
- **`temperature`**: Average temperature in celsius per country
- **`region`**: Geographical region corresponding to each country.
- **`category`**: Classification of the country as "First World," "Second World," or "Third World."

#### Additional Dataset (`countriesExtra.csv`)
- **`country`**: Matches the country names from the main dataset.
- **`continent`**: Continent corresponding to each country.

### Important Tidyverse Functions
- **Filtering**: Filter data based on conditions such as year, country, or region.
- **Selecting**: Select specific columns for focused analysis.
- **Mutating**: Create new columns, such as cases per 100,000 population.
- **Summarizing**: Aggregate data by country, year, or region to find totals and averages.
- **Joining**: Combine the main dataset with the additional data based on country.

## Diving into Data Wrangling

### Filtering

Filtering is essential for narrowing down datasets to the most relevant information, making patterns easier to identify.

#### Scenario 1:
You are tasked with visualizing trends in life expectancy in Asian countries between 2010 and 2020.

#### Filtering Process
```{webr-r}
filteredData <- countriesDs %>%
  filter(year >= 2010 & year <= 2020 & region == "Asia")

head(filteredData, 5)
```

#### Visualization
```{webr-r}
ggplot(filteredData, aes(x = factor(year), y = life_expectancy, color = country)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Life Expectancy Trends in Asia (2010-2020)",
       x = "Year", y = "Life Expectancy") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Why Filtering Helps

By focusing on specific countries and years, filtering allows for more targeted and relevant visualizations, making it easier to analyze trends and patterns specific to the context.

#### Scenario 2:
Analyze the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy in European countries with a GDP per capita above $30,000 for the years 2015-2020.

#### Filtering Process
```{webr-r}
filteredData <- countriesDs %>%
  filter(year >= 2015 & year <= 2020 & region == "Europe" & gdp_per_capita > 30000) %>%
  left_join(countriesExtraDs, by = "country")

head(filteredData, 5)
```

#### Visualization
```{webr-r}
ggplot(filteredData, aes(x = gdp_per_capita, y = life_expectancy, color = country)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "GDP per Capita vs. Life Expectancy in Europe (2015-2020)",
       x = "GDP per Capita", y = "Life Expectancy") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Why Filtering Helps

Filtering based on economic indicators allows for focused analysis on the relationship between wealth and life expectancy, removing noise from countries with different economic conditions.

#### Filtering Challenges
1. **Population Size in Africa**:
   - **Filter**: Only countries from Africa where the population exceeds 50 million.
   - **Purpose**: Isolate data for large African nations to analyze trends specific to highly populated areas.

2. **Economic Data in Europe**:
   - **Filter**: Show data only for the years 2015-2020 for European countries with GDP per capita above $30,000.
   - **Purpose**: Focus on wealthy European countries during a specific period to study economic outcomes.

3. **High Birth Rates in Asia**:
   - **Filter**: Data for Asian countries where the birth rate is above 2.5.
   - **Purpose**: Analyze regions with high birth rates, possibly indicating population growth trends.

4. **Cold Regions in Asia**:
   - **Filter**: Asian countries where the average temperature is below 10°C between 2010 and 2020.
   - **Purpose**: Focus on colder regions in Asia to study how temperature may correlate with other demographic factors.

5. **GDP Data with Missing Values**:
   - **Filter**: Remove any entries with missing `gdp_per_capita` values for the years 2010-2020.
   - **Purpose**: Ensure clean data for economic analysis, removing incomplete records that could skew results.

### Selecting

Selecting allows you to focus on specific columns relevant to your analysis.

```{webr-r}
selectedData <- filteredData %>%
  select(country, year, gdp_per_capita, life_expectancy)

head(selectedData, 5)
```

#### Selecting Challenges
1. **Select columns** related to economic indicators (e.g., `country`, `gdp_per_capita`, `population`) for further analysis.
2. **Create a dataset** with only the `year`, `life_expectancy`, and `temperature` columns for all countries and show the first 5 rows.
3. **Choose columns** that exclude any geographical information and check the first 10 rows.
4. **Select and rename** the `country` and `population` columns to `nation` and `pop_size`, respectively.
5. **Create a new dataset** with only the `year`, `population`, and a newly created column, `population_in_millions` (which should be calculated as `population / 1e6`).

### Mutating

Mutating helps create new columns based on existing data.

```{webr-r}
mutatedData <- countriesDs %>%
  mutate(gdp_total = gdp_per_capita * population)

head(mutatedData, 5)
```

#### Mutating Challenges
1. **Create a new column** called `gdp_total` that multiplies `gdp_per_capita` by `population`.
2. **Add a new column** that indicates whether a country's GDP per capita is above or below a certain threshold (e.g., $20,000).
3. **Mutate the `temperature` column** to create a new column, `temperature_f`, that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.
4. **Create a `population_density` column** by dividing `population` by a given area (assuming you have area data).
5. **Generate a column** that calculates the ratio of birth rate to life expectancy for each country.

### Summarizing

Summarizing aggregates data by country, year, or region to find totals and averages.

```{webr-r}
summaryData <- countriesDs %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_life_expectancy = mean(life_expectancy, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_population = sum(population, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

head(summaryData, 5)
```

#### Summarizing Challenges
1. **Summarize the dataset** by finding the average temperature for each region.
2. **Aggregate the data** to find the total population and average life expectancy for each continent.
3. **Group the data** by country and summarize to find the maximum and minimum GDP per capita for each country.
4. **Summarize by year** to find the total population and average birth rate each year.
5. **Create a summary** that calculates the total population and average GDP per capita for countries classified as "First World."


### Handling Dates

In some cases, it might be necessary to convert a `year` column from a numeric format (double) into a proper date format for time series analysis or plotting purposes. Here’s how you can do that in R using the `lubridate` package.

#### Converting `year` to a Date

Let's convert the `year` column into a date format, setting it as January 1st of that year.

```{webr-r}
# Ensure the lubridate package is loaded

# Convert the year column to a date format (January 1st of each year)
countriesDs <- countriesDs %>%
  mutate(year_date = ymd(paste0(year, "-01-01")))

# Check the first few rows to see the new column
head(countriesDs, 5)
```

#### Explanation:
- **`paste0(year, "-01-01")`**: Combines the year with the string "-01-01" to create a date string like "2010-01-01".
- **`ymd()`**: Converts the resulting string into a date object in the "Year-Month-Day" format.

This creates a new column, `year_date`, which is now in the proper date format.

#### Converting Year to Date Challenges

1. **Convert year to end of year date**:
   - **Task**: Convert the `year` column to a date format, but set it as December 31st of that year.
   - **Purpose**: Useful for representing data that summarizes annual results.

   ```{webr-r}
   countriesDs <- countriesDs %>%
     mutate(year_end_date = ymd(paste0(year, "-12-31")))

   head(countriesDs, 5)
   ```

2. **Create a quarterly date**:
   - **Task**: Convert the `year` column into a date representing the first quarter (e.g., "2010-03-31").
   - **Purpose**: Useful for quarterly analysis.

   ```{webr-r}
   countriesDs <- countriesDs %>%
     mutate(quarter_date = ymd(paste0(year, "-03-31")))

   head(countriesDs, 5)
   ```

3. **Mid-year date conversion**:
   - **Task**: Convert the `year` column to a date format, setting it as June 30th of each year.
   - **Purpose**: Represents mid-year data points.

   ```{webr-r}
   countriesDs <- countriesDs %>%
     mutate(mid_year_date = ymd(paste0(year, "-06-30")))

   head(countriesDs, 5)
   ```

4. **Use year as a dynamic time period**:
   - **Task**: Convert the `year` column to represent the last day of a chosen month (e.g., November).
   - **Purpose**: Allows for flexibility depending on the analysis context.

   ```{webr-r}
   chosen_month <- "11"
   countriesDs <- countriesDs %>%
     mutate(chosen_month_date = ymd(paste0(year, "-", chosen_month, "-30")))

   head(countriesDs, 5)
   ```

5. **Convert year to fiscal year start date**:
   - **Task**: Convert the `year` column into a date representing the start of the fiscal year (e.g., April 1st).
   - **Purpose**: Useful for financial and budgetary analyses.

   ```{webr-r}
   countriesDs <- countriesDs %>%
     mutate(fiscal_year_start = ymd(paste0(year, "-04-01")))

   head(countriesDs, 5)
   ```


### Joining

Joining combines data from the main dataset with additional data.

```{webr-r}
joinedData <- left_join(countriesDs, countriesExtraDs, by = "country")

head(joinedData, 5)
```

#### Joining Challenges
1. **Perform a left join** on the main dataset and an additional dataset that contains information on urbanization rates by country.
2. **Join the datasets** to add `continent` and then filter for countries in a specific continent.
3. **Create a new dataset** by performing an inner join on `countriesDs` and `countriesExtraDs`, then analyze the countries present in both datasets.
4. **Perform a full join** to combine the datasets and identify countries that are missing from one dataset but present in the other.
5. **Use an anti-join** to find the countries in the main dataset that do not have corresponding information in the additional dataset.


## Mastering Data Wrangling for Stunning Visualizations

We’ll combine all the data wrangling techniques you’ve learned—`filtering`, `selecting`, `mutating`, `summarizing`, and `joining`—to perform a detailed analysis and produce a polished, publication-ready visualization.

### Creating a Professional-Quality Visualization

Here’s a step-by-step guide to transform and visualize data from 10 countries in the dataset:

```{webr-r}
# Step 1: Filter the dataset for Asian and European countries from 2020 to 2023
filteredData <- countriesDs %>%
  filter(year >= 2020 & year <= 2023)

# Step 2: Join with the additional dataset to get continent information
joinedData <- filteredData %>%
  left_join(countriesExtraDs, by = "country")

# Step 3: Select relevant columns for analysis
selectedData <- joinedData %>%
  select(country, year, population, gdp_per_capita, life_expectancy, birth_rate, continent)

# Step 4: Mutate the data to create new metrics
mutatedData <- selectedData %>%
  mutate(
    gdp_total = gdp_per_capita * population,
    year_date = ymd(paste0(year, "-", ifelse(runif(n()) > 0.5, "06-30", "12-31")))
  )

# Step 5: Summarize the data to get average life expectancy, GDP per capita, and total population by country and continent
summaryData <- mutatedData %>%
  group_by(continent, country) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_life_expectancy = mean(life_expectancy, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_gdp_per_capita = mean(gdp_per_capita, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_population_millions = sum(population, na.rm = TRUE) / 1e6  # Convert population to millions
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

# Step 6: Create a publication-ready visualization
ggplot(summaryData, aes(
  x = avg_gdp_per_capita, 
  y = avg_life_expectancy, 
  size = total_population_millions,  # Use population in millions for size mapping
  color = country
)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(min(summaryData$avg_life_expectancy) - 1, 66)) +  # Adjust y-axis scale to go up to 66
  scale_size_continuous(
    range = c(5, 15),  # Adjust the bubble size range
    name = "Total Population (Millions)", 
    breaks = c(50, 200, 500, 1000, 1500),  # Adjust based on realistic population ranges in millions
    labels = c("50M", "200M", "500M", "1B", "1.5B")  # Correct labels in millions
  ) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(guide = "none") +  # Hide the color legend
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy Across Countries",
    subtitle = "Bubble size represents total population across 2020-2023",
    x = "Average GDP per Capita (USD)",
    y = "Average Life Expectancy (Years)",
    caption = "Data Source: Synthetic Dataset"
  ) +
  geom_text(aes(label = country), hjust = 0.5, size = 3, color = "black") + # Labels centered
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "Georgia"),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 11, face = "bold"), 
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9, face = "italic"), 
    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 8), 
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8), 
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
```

### Visualization Review

**Visualization**: The final product is a bubble plot that visually represents the relationship between GDP per capita (a key economic indicator) and life expectancy across the 10 countries. Each bubble corresponds to a country, with the size of the bubble reflecting its total population. This allows you to see not just how wealthy and healthy each country is, but also how large it is in terms of population.

**Publication-Ready**: The plot is designed to be clean, simple, and professional. We’ve used specific text styles for titles and subtitles to ensure clarity, and selected color schemes that are accessible to everyone, including those who are colorblind. This makes the visualization suitable for both academic presentations and professional reports.

By mastering this approach, you'll see how various data wrangling techniques can be combined to create a powerful and insightful visualization. This process transforms raw data into a compelling story that is both informative and visually appealing, whether you’re working on a class project or preparing a professional report.
